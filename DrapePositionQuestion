Sorry, I wasn't sure how to ask this properly so I created this pull request. 

What's the best way of accessing the positions of all the Marauders in Extraterrestial Mauraders (great name by the way).
I know they're in the Drape but am having trouble figuring out how to get the updated positions.

I'm hoping to practice doing some AI algorithms, and were hoping to find these positions reliably to use in a feature-based
implementation.

Thank you!!!
